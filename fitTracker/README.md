This is a basic fitness tracker program developed as an Internal Assessment Project for IB Computer Science, 2017-2018. This program is designed to act as a fitness tracker, by accepting step counts and hours slept on a daily basis. The program will store this information and track the fulfillment of step and sleeping goals (these are stored and can be modified at any time).
