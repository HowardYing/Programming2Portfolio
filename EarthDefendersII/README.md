# Earth Defenders II

This is a simple, terminal based game where the player tries to move the V to catch asterisks which constantly move downwards. The game is somewhat turn based, as the game waits for player instructions, introducing an element of strategy into the game.

This application was made using Java. Two dimensional arrays were used to store and display the game field, and array lists were used in order to control the player movement.
