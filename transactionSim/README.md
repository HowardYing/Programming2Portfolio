This is a transaction simulator with support for checking and savings accounts. It is designed to offer a basic simulation of common bank transactions between these two accounts, with support for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The entire program is executed in the command line; there is no GUI.

# Code

This calculator application was made using Java. The application uses if statements to determine which transaction the user desires, and a rudimentary menu system has been implemented. Custom methods could have been implemented to make the code more efficient, but the focus with this program was to create advanced decision making trees.
