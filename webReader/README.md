This is a basic webpage data extraction application, which points to a particular website, and copys the html code into an external output file. The goal was to become more familiarized with Input/Output formats available in Java, as well as using URL data. The entire program is executed in the command line; there is no GUI.

This calculator application was made using Java. The application accepts a website URL as a string, and uses java.net.URL to navigate to and extract the website data. Java FileWriter was used to write the output to a "data.txt" file, found in the same directory.
